#JavaScript final test

Anime search app

The aim of this app is allowing the user to perform a search by title, select
their favourite shows and storage them in local.

🏅MILESTONES🏅

1. We have used a basic HTML structure for the page static elements 📑

2. Search: 🔍

- Request to the Jikan API (fetch)
- Search by title (a variable keeps the user's search, button listens a click event)
- Render the results (having in mind that when the image is missing, we should insert a placeholder image)

3. Favourites: 💜
   User can click any of the result and this should happen:

- The clicked item will change its color (or different style)
- The clicked item will be included in the Favourites list
- The Favourites list will be rendered
- The clicked item will be stored in local

4. Local Storage: 🗃️

- We will use localStorage to keep the favourite list displayed if the page is refreshed

💯 BONUS 💯

- Apply a Reset button to reset (globally or individually) the results of the Favourites list. This button should also erase the locaStorage
- Add CSS styles
